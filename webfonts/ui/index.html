        <h2 style="text-align: left">Introduction and Motivation</h2>
		<br>
        <p style="text-align: left" >
			The availability of billions of high resolution satellite time lapse imagery gives us the potential to use computer vision to study our cities, and help governments come up with effective policies. While researchers like Blummenstock et al have used mobile phone data to predict poverty rates in Rwanda [1], and Jean et al used satellite imagery to do this in 4 African countries [2], the potential to do more complex analyses using imagery on the African continent has largely been unexplored. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<p style="text-align: left" >
			The legacy of apartheid in South Africa continues to disrupt society today. Apartheid is the
			former policy of economic and political discrimination, and segregation against non-european groups
			in South Africa. One such example is that of spatial apartheid, where residential areas were
			segregated based on race. The remnants of such policies are still visible today and moving around
			residential areas shows many completely segregated neighbourhoods of townships next to gated
			wealthy neighbourhoods that have largely remained unaffected by the ending of apartheid.
		 </p>
		 <br>	
		 <p style="text-align: left">
			For example, Figures 1 and 2 show some aerial images taken by photographer Johnny Miller, depicting completely segregated neighbourhoods of townships next to gated wealthy neighborhoods that have largely remained unaffected by the ending of apartheid [3]. Although this effect is immediately obvious to any human looking at these photos, people cannot quickly analyze millions of such images and gain insights.

		 <br> 
        <h2 style="text-align: left">Aim</h2>
		<br>
        <p style="text-align: left" >
			Our research proposes the use of computer vision to analyse satellite images of South Africa from 2006
			to 2016. This work aims to understand the relationship between the spatial and socioeconomic
			makeup of neighbourhoods in South Africa, and also studies how they have evolved over time in post
			Apartheid.
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2 style="text-align: left">The specific questions we would like to answer are:</h2>
        <ol>
		<br>
		<li>
			<p style="text-align: left" >
				
				Can we use computer vision to understand the evolution of the built environment
				in three municipal areas: Ekurhuleni, City of Cape town and Msunduzi municipal
				areas post 2009?
			</p>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
			<p style="text-align: left" >
				 Will the DeepLab3 trained on top of WideResNet38 [6] or the Unet [25] Semantic
				Segmentation model fine-tuned with our satellite image dataset be able to detect
				and classifying neighbourhoods?
			</p>
		</ol>
		<br>
		<h2 style="text-align: left">Research Objectives:</h2>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p style="text-align: left" >
					Automatically identify and cluster neighbourhoods such as townships and wealthy neighbourhoods using various computer vision techniques with a special focus on semantic segmentation methods based in deep learning.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p style="text-align: left" >
					Measure the sizes of these neighbourhoods and shapes over time.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p style="text-align: left" >
					We will be able to detect neighbourhoods on satellite images automatically.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p style="text-align: left" >
					Use average household income from the meso-zone dataset on overlaid neighbourhood polygons as a proxy for neighbourhood type.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p style="text-align: left" >
					Predict the economic status of a neighbourhood using a classification model and expand on the economic dataset using the classifier.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h2 style="text-align: left">Methodology</h2>
		<br>
        <p style="text-align: left" >
			To accomplish this we will be using satellite images, geographically and semantically
			labelled coordinates of all the buildings in South Africa and socioeconomic data to build a semantic
			segmentation model that can predict a geographical neighbourhood class as township, suburb,
			informal settlement, etc. In addition to automatically detecting and classifying neighbourhoods, we
			plan to use demographic and socioeconomic data to analyze the change over time in the demographic
			makeup, economic status and access to basic resources such as the number of clinics and schools of
			these detected neighbourhoods.

				<br>Poster link:<a href="http://tiny.cc/wly04y"> Presented poster Poster</a>
				<br>Short abstract was accepted for this work in both WIML and BAI. 
				<br> <br><b>Feedback:</b> The paper proposes the use of semantic segmentation models for segmenting neighborhoods in aerial images of cities. The paper could consider instance segmentation instead; instance segmentation may be more appropriate to segment and separate out individual neighborhoods from each other.
				<br><br> <b>Feedback:</b> It would be good if by the time of presentation this research could also include some preliminary technical work or a more sophisticated data analysis than what is currently presented in the paper.
				<br><br> <b>Feedback:</b> The reviewers look forward to seeing more results and analyzes as the work is completed.
				<br><br> <b>Feedback:</b> I would appreciate if the authors could take into account the specificities of South Africa in comparison to other countries. For future work, I recommend using additional data (such as census information) to: (1) gather additional insights on the people living at the detected communities; (2) helping to distinguish between small schools/clinics and houses, which might be hard to do solely by aerial images
				<br><br> <b>Feedback:</b> I would like to know more about how these changes would be quantitatively measured (area of segmented areas? ratio of urban to non-urban areas?). Something about this would be good to include in the poster, if accepted to WiML. 
				<br><br> <b>Feedback:</b> Could have been a Strong Accept if it could throw some light on the current technical work in progress/results
				<br><br> <b>Feedback:</b> The reviewers appreciated social importance of the application and the effort put into creating an appropriate dataset for the task. At the same time, they also noted preliminary nature of this work and therefore lack of significant technical contributions. For these reasons, I recommend this work for acceptance as a poster.

				<h5 style="text-align: left"><u>Polygons of Neighbourhoods</u></h5>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 16px;">We have a dataset of polygons subdividing neighbourhoods in the country. They are divided into two categories: Enumerator Areas (EA) and Main place.
				<br><br> <b>A Main place</b> is an enumeration of several EAs and each EA typically consists of between 100 and 250 households. There is a total of <b>80 787</b> EAs and a total of <b>14 039</b> Main places in the country. These are permanant dermacations made by the government post Apartheid.

Looking at the images below from the test set- We can sort of see why it is easy to confuse them given the fact that they often look similar(especially on land that has not been farmed in a while). We will perhaps consider merging these two classes in the next iteration.</p>
