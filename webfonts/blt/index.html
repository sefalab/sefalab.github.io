							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>Works from the FAccT community have discussed the values, often not explicitly stated, encoded in machine learning research (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3531146.3533083">Birhane et al. 2022</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Arvind_Narayanan">Narayanan 2018</a>, <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/liu19f.html">Liu & Hardt 2019</a>), and how the operationalization of these values negatively impacts marginalised communities (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3531146.3533083">Birhane et al. 2022</a>). For instance, Birhane et al. notes, that “these top values are being defined and applied with assumptions and implications generally supporting the centralization of power.” Indeed, BigTech companies claim to build one model that accomplishes many tasks, aiding in their centralization of power, while in reality these models result  in sub par accuracies, even by their own metrics, for non dominant languages. For instance, <a href="https://pml4dc.github.io/iclr2023/pdf/PML4DC_ICLR2023_39.pdf">Hadgu et al</a> showed that Meta’s No Language Left Behind dataset and model which claims to have state-of-the-art language translation for 200 languages, including 54 African languages, was outperformed by models from <a href="https://ghananlp.org/">Ghana NLP</a> for Twi. However, hype from organisations like Meta claiming to have a one-model-for-everything approach, has harmed small community rooted organisations like <a href="https://ghananlp.org/">Ghana NLP</a> and <a href="http://lesan.ai">Lesan AI</a>, focused on building resource constrained and task specific models addressing the needs of their communities.</p>
							<p>These small organizations have created models that outperform those from Big Tech companies in tasks pertaining to their specific communities, because model builders encode values aligned with their communities' needs, at every step of the decision making process in the research and development pipeline. These decisions range from the dataset design choices influenced by the relationships of these ML practitioners to the culture and language they are familiar with, to decisions on model architecture and metrics for evaluation. This raises questions like : How do the design choices of a researcher deeply familiar with a language's political, cultural, and historical context differ from those of a researcher with limited understanding of this context?</p>

							<h2>Goals</h2>
							<p>The goal of this session is to present 3 case studies in natural language processing and computer vision applications, and discuss various decisions made by practitioners building for specific communities they are in. The session will also give examples of how these decisions differ when builders are not aware of these specific contexts. Specifically, we want to explore the following questions with our participants:</p>
							<ol>1. How did you come to this research/product idea and why did you think AI would be the appropriate tool for this problem? </ol>
							<ol>2. As a builder, what guides the data and data types you include or exclude in your study?</ol>
							<ol>3. How did you decide that you have enough data?</ol>
							<ol>4. How did you decide on your model architecture?</ol>
							<ol>5. How did you decide on the evaluation protocol, including the chosen metrics, and how does this differ from the evaluation done by those who don’t know the cultural contexts that you operate in?</ol>
