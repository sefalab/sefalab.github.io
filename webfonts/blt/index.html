							<p>In this CRAFT workshop, we invite machine learning practitioners building small, task specific models addressing the needs of specific communities they know and are parts of, to discuss how knowledge of their communities impacts the decisions they make while building ML products. </p>

							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>Big Tech’s “one-model-for-everything” approach aids centralization of power by multinational corporations, while resulting in subpar performance, even by metrics used by these companies, for non-dominant populations. Simultaneously, hype from Big Tech companies promoting the one-model-for-everything approach, has harmed small, community-rooted organizations which focus on building task-specific models suited for their contexts. These small organizations have developed models that outperform those from Big Tech because they understand the complexities of the cultures they operate in. This contextual understanding results in datasets, model architectures, and evaluation metrics that are different from those of Big Tech. In this session, we ask: how do the design choices of a researcher deeply familiar with the social context of a particular community, differ from those of a researcher with limited understanding of this context? We will use case studies and participatory methods to map how contextual knowledge impacts what types of machine learning models are built.</p>
							<p>These small organizations have created models that outperform those from Big Tech companies in tasks pertaining to their specific communities, because model builders encode values aligned with their communities' needs, at every step of the decision making process in the research and development pipeline. These decisions range from the dataset design choices influenced by the relationships of these ML practitioners to the culture and language they are familiar with, to decisions on model architecture and metrics for evaluation. This raises questions like : How do the design choices of a researcher deeply familiar with a language's political, cultural, and historical context differ from those of a researcher with limited understanding of this context?</p>

							<h2>Goals</h2>
							<p>The goal of this session is to present 3 case studies in natural language processing and computer vision applications, and discuss various decisions made by practitioners building for specific communities they are in. The session will also give examples of how these decisions differ when builders are not aware of these specific contexts. Specifically, we want to explore the following questions with our participants:</p>
							<ol>1. How did you come to this research/product idea and why did you think AI would be the appropriate tool for this problem? </ol>
							<ol>2. As a builder, what guides the data and data types you include or exclude in your study?</ol>
							<ol>3. How did you decide that you have enough data?</ol>
							<ol>4. How did you decide on your model architecture?</ol>
							<ol>5. How did you decide on the evaluation protocol, including the chosen metrics, and how does this differ from the evaluation done by those who don’t know the cultural contexts that you operate in?</ol>
